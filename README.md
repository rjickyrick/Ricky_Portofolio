# Ricky_Portofolio
A collection of selected data science projects to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and what I find interesting

## Contents
* __Artificial Intelligence__:
* __PythonOOP__: An object oriented programming example in Python 3 which will run simulations of the El Farol problem from complexity theory
* __PythonWebScraping__: Simple web scraping example using Python's `beautifulsoup` and some initial processing, feature generation in R for international rugby scoring statistics.
* __Pygame__: Making a game using Python to invent an interactive game that is able to be enjoyed by both parties.
*__R__: Slight coding using R to make a web scrapper from a database on the web

## [Example Data Science Projects]
## In Progress
* __Movement of old projects into this repository__
  * Machine learning projects (multiple)
  * Dockerized applications
* __New and ongoing projects__
  * More machine learning projects
    * Focus on deep learning architectures, reinforcement learning, time series applications
  * R Shiny applications, to be deployed to public R Shiny Server
  * Other application + visualization tools
  * Custom-written ML algorithms
    * Re-implementations to dive deeper into theory
    * Possible variants on existing algorithms
